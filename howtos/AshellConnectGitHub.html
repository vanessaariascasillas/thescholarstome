<h4 id="tags-a-shell-github-howto-instructions">Tags: A-shell,
        GitHub, HowTo, Instructions</h4>
<p>Intro: I have had a hard time in the past trying to make .txt
        files and being able to work on simple files on GitHub repos
        from my phone and iPad. There are times when I wanted to just
        write a quick journal entry or work on a file on my repo while I
        was waiting for a friend to show up for a lunch hangout, or when
        I was just bored waiting. I am excited that this exists.</p>
<p>A-Shell is an app in the App Store that I found recently due
        to someone saying that they only had their iPad for a workshop
        on GitHub. In the instructions of the workshop, we ask them to
        use a computer, but this happens more often than not. So I went
        on the search for a GitHub iPad GUI. At first, I found one that
        looked amazing, it had all the terms and did almost all the same
        items as GitHub Desktop, but they charged you to push… I was so
        disappointed, then I found another one that let you do 3 pushes
        for free, then you had to pay. I was slightly less disappointed.
        Yet this got me thinking and searching to see if I can do it
        with the command line for free. Which is when I found A-shell,
        this is where the headache started for a different reason. I
        needed to set up the connection to pull and push to GitHub. I
        was unaware of what my next 8 hours would look like.</p>
<p>Side note scene set up time (This is for nothing about
        a-shell, I just wanted to write this): It was a Friday night, my
        cousin was having a small birthday party for her now 7-year-old
        child. She decided to hire a magician to do some magic, which
        actually entertained not just the small children but all of the
        adults there. There I was sitting on my phone half looking up at
        each magic trick, trying to connect a-shell to GitHub, and as I
        am silently cussing to myself, “I did make it, why is it not
        working?” I keep getting the same error: the .ssh does not
        exist, when I did the cat copy code to put it into GitHub’s
        settings.</p>
<p>So once I was at the house, I was able to really research
        what was going on, which is when I found the forum post (I did
        try ChatGPT by the way, ChatGPT tells you just go to the .ssh
        folder or here is the code, it will work. Whereas a forum post
        will say, dude, I know I went through the same struggles, here
        is everything I have tried, and this is how I fixed it. This is
        why I will always appreciate forums more than a chatbot.) that
        told me what I was missing, which is exactly where the .ssh
        folder is on the iPad, when the pwd is semi lying to you… (it
        was not, but it was not picking it up with the CAT code, and
        when you went looking for it, it was like nope, I am not here,
        until after 8 hours, it was like ” AHA YOU FOUND ME!“) because
        you had just decided to write the same cd, then press tab not in
        the root folder, but in the folder you were in the entire time.
        So, below are the steps for future me, so I do not forget.</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open A-shell</li>
<li>install git</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">&gt;</span>pkg <span class="fu">install</span> git</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Check with ls that there is a bin folder</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">&gt;</span>ls</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Also, check what commands you can do with lg2</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb3-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">&gt;</span> lg2</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Clone the git repo from GitHub. You will need the URL of the
        repo you are cloning. There is no big green button on the phone
        app, so go to repo, click the circle with the three dots, and
        click share, then just click the option copy. You will have to
        add “.git” at the end.</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">&gt;</span> git <span class="ex">clone</span> <span class="st">"GitHub Repo URL with .git at the end"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Check with ls that your repo is there</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb5-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">&gt;</span> ls</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Now generate the public/private key</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb6-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">&gt;</span> ssh-keygen <span class="ex">-t</span> rsa <span class="at">-b</span> 4096 <span class="at">-C</span> <span class="st">"your email you use on GitHub"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>Click enter for default file name and file folder, unless
        one already exists, click Y first, then for the passwords, click
        enter, then enter (You can make your first protected with
        passcodes, I did…) It will give you the path it’s saved at for
        both private and public, and display the fingerprint, text, and
        graphic.</p></li>
<li><p>In the folder where you have the bin and the git clone,
        write cd, then hit tab, then type a dot, then “s” the .ssh/
        should come up if it doesn’t, you will probably have to have an
        extra set of fun searching the answer for next 8 hours, I
        recommend going to a magic show first. But it should have come
        up; I have tested it many times. Go into that folder</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb7-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">&gt;</span> cd <span class="ex">.ssh/</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Check that the keys are in there with ls</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb8-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">&gt;</span> ls</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>display the public key and manually copy it</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb9-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">&gt;</span> head <span class="ex">id_ed25519.pub</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>Go to GitHub on a browser (I used Firefox on my iPad and
        phone), navigate to the settings, then to SSH and GPG keys,
        click the green button that says “New SSH key”, call it the
        device, and then paste the manually copied public key. This is a
        good point to make a GPG key, you will need it when you git push
        to the repo.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the GPG key, IMPORTANT: IT WILL ONLY DISPLAY THE
        TEXT IT GIVES YOU FOR THE GPG KEY ONCE. MAKE SURE TO COPY AND
        SAVE IT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT IS SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE. I have a
        friend who told me it was a pain replacing the old one. You do
        not want to go through that, right?</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, finally! Let’s test it! Navigate to the git repo
        folder and make sure you are inside it.</p></li>

        there. (I tried my GitHub password for a good 10 attempts before
        I remembered to use the GPG key (if it gives you a error that
        says “Error Pushing [-1] - unexpected EOF”, they go buy a ticket
        to the local magic show… it will be another 8 hours)</p></li>
<li><p>Success <em>chit’s voice</em> (TikTok reference), if it
        says pushed. If, for some odd reason, you get the error “Error
        Pushing [-1] - unexpected EOF” or something else as an error… do
        you like card tricks? I know a magician you might like.
        Overplayed joke… yeah, I know, but you now have a inside joke
        with me (or yourself). But go check that it is on your GitHub
        Repo Online.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Summary: Well, that is how you connect a-shell to your
        GitHub. To future me, I know you are going to want to thank past
        you (me) for taking the time to write this out, buy me a coffee
        or lunch if you want.</p>
<p>Time it takes to set up if successful: 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>Links to the forums that I found useful:
        “https://forum.obsidian.md/t/mobile-automatic-sync-with-github-on-ios-for-free-via-a-shell/46150?page=2”
        it has links to other websites including the main GitHub
        Documentation on SSH, it is for Obsindian app, but it gave me
        the information to fix my issue.</p>
